# kcms
Simple Custom 'Kontent' Management System base. 

This CMS is to be used as a basic FrameWork for creating a blog/content site. 
It is not meant to be a replacement for WordPress etc, but simply as a BASE for your own Java Servlet adventures. 

This should be considered pre-alpha and nowhere near ready for production AS-IS. 

TO DO:
ADD and Change the customized controllers into a more general post based setup.
This is going to take a while...
